# Samsara Tattoos — Backend Documentation

## Overview

This document describes how authentication, bookings, and gallery management work in the Samsara Tattoos backend.

---

## Auth Flow

### Register

```
User sends firstName, lastName, email, password, phoneNumber
        ↓
Check if email already exists in MongoDB
        ↓
Create user (password is hashed automatically via Mongoose pre-save hook)
        ↓
Generate JWT token
        ↓
Return token + user
```

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/users/register`

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "firstName": "Pratik",
  "lastName": "Maharjan",
  "email": "pratik@gmail.com",
  "password": "Pratik1234",
  "phoneNumber": "9812345678"
}
```

**Success Response** `201`:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "token": "jwt.token.here",
  "user": { ... }
}
```

---

### Login

```
User sends email + password
        ↓
Find user by email in MongoDB
        ↓
Compare plain password with hashed password using bcrypt
        ↓
Generate JWT token
        ↓
Return token + user
```

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/users/login`

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "email": "pratik@gmail.com",
  "password": "Pratik1234"
}
```

**Success Response** `200`:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "token": "jwt.token.here",
  "user": { ... }
}
```

---

## Protected Routes

For routes that require authentication, include the JWT token in the request header:

```
Authorization: Bearer <your_token>
```

The `protect` middleware will:

```
Request comes in with token in header
        ↓
Verify token is valid (using JWT_SECRET)
        ↓
Find user from token's id
        ↓
Attach user to req.user
        ↓
Controller runs
```

---

## Role & Authorization

Three roles exist with different levels of access:

| Role | Access |
|---|---|
| `user` | Public routes only (submit booking, view gallery) |
| `admin` | Gallery upload/delete, view and manage bookings |
| `superadmin` | Everything including user management and role assignment |

The `authorize` middleware protects role-restricted routes:
```
Request passes protect middleware (token verified)
        ↓
authorize checks req.user.role against allowed roles
        ↓
Match → controller runs
No match → 403 Forbidden
```

---

## Booking Flow

### Submit a Booking (Public)

```
User fills booking form (name, email, phone, date, tattoo idea, optional image)
        ↓
POST /api/bookings
        ↓
Data saved to MongoDB with status: "pending"
        ↓
Return booking confirmation
```

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/bookings`

**Request:** `multipart/form-data` (supports image upload)

```json
{
  "firstName": "Pratik",
  "lastName": "Maharjan",
  "email": "pratik@gmail.com",
  "phoneNumber": "9812345678",
  "date": "2025-05-10",
  "tattooIdea": "A dragon on my forearm",
  "referenceImage": "(optional image file)"
}
```

**Success Response** `201`:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Booking request submitted successfully",
  "booking": {
    "_id": "...",
    "firstName": "Pratik",
    "status": "pending",
    ...
  }
}
```

---

### Manage Bookings (Admin / Superadmin)

```
Admin logs in and gets JWT token
        ↓
Sends request with token in Authorization header
        ↓
protect + authorize("admin", "superadmin") middleware runs
        ↓
Controller executes
```

**Get all bookings:**
`GET /api/bookings` — returns all bookings, newest first

Optional filter by status:
`GET /api/bookings?status=pending`

**Get single booking:**
`GET /api/bookings/:id`

**Update booking status:**
`PATCH /api/bookings/:id/status`

```json
{
  "status": "confirmed",
  "notes": "Call before visit"
}
```

**Delete booking:**
`DELETE /api/bookings/:id`

**Booking statuses:**

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `pending` | Newly submitted, awaiting review |
| `confirmed` | Admin has approved the appointment |
| `rejected` | Admin has declined the request |

---

## Gallery Flow

### View Gallery (Public)

```
GET /api/gallery
        ↓
Returns all images sorted by newest first
```

## Security Notes

- Passwords are **never stored in plain text** — hashed via bcrypt pre-save hook
- JWT tokens expire as configured in `JWT_EXPIRE_IN` env variable
- Token must be sent on every protected request via `Authorization` header
- Swagger docs should be **disabled in production** to avoid exposing API structure
- Uploaded images are served as static files via `/uploads` — consider moving to Cloudinary/S3 in production
